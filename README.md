# MVC-tech-blog

## Objective of the Application

As a developer who writes about tech I want a CMS-style blog site
so that I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions.

## How it Works

While visiting The Tech Blog, the user is shown a homepage with a navigation bar and already existing blog posts.
In the navigation bar, a user that is not logged in is presented with two options: "Home" and "Login".
Because the user is not logged in he/she can not post blogs themselves, but they may still view other blogs on the homepage.
The user then can choose to log in.
The Login page will have two separate options where the user can either sign up, or log in with a previous account.
The Sign up option is located at the bottom of the login container in red font.
The user must enter a valid username and password to be saved into the site, where they can log in later.
Once logged in, the users navigation bar is now "Home", "Dashboard", and "Logout".
The "Home" navigation is the same as before, but now the user can click on the blog post and leave a comment.
When the user enters a comment and click on the submit button while signed in the 
comment is saved and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creatorâ€™s username, and the date created.
The dashboard navigation allows the user to create their own blogs with a title and content section.
Press create when the post is finished, and now this post is now published to the site with the users name, date, and content.
Previous posts can be edited by the user, deleted, or commented upon.
When the user is finsihed with their experience, they can select log out in the navigation bar at the top.
